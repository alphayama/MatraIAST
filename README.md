## How it works
Press and hold letter then hit space bar or arrow key to select the accent. For example `e` & `‚éµ`. With spacebar, repeat stroke to change letter. When releasing the letter key, the accent is inserted.

The software is currently working with `a`, `d`, `e`, `h`, `i`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`.
## Download
I haven't released the installer for the project yet.

## Problems known
- (Experimental feature) Inside browsers & some other softwares, the tool can't detect the caret position. So default is applied, meaning up center of the main window

## The future
- Trying to keep this project up to date with the original project
- Theme & design improvement
